## RaspClaw Scripts
This package contains the scripts for making the raspclaw lean left, right and standup. The move.py is also in here but Adeept_raspclaws must be working in order to use this script. If you have not met with me to fix your bot, this will not help you until you meet me during my office hours.

You can take this code and edit it to your liking. It is open source and I have no issue with you making edits. However, just executing this code and expecting your robot to work will take effort on your part. If you show this to Dr. Jamshidi without any effort in expanding on the code during your final presentation and you merely copy and pasted, I will call you out on it and report it to Dr. Jamshidi.

This is merely examples on how to move your robot's legs and to give you an idea and some motivation to take it further and add modules like implementing this in a obstacle avoidance program or a object tracking program. If you claim this code as yours (If you made no edits and you are just lazy. Yes, I know who you are cause I can tell, I ain't dumb), I can easily disprove you and will report it to Dr. Jamshidi. Again, feel free to edit and make it do whatever you want, but don't just copy and paste, put some effort.

If you have any questions, email me at: asibarra98@gmail.com

I will be glad to help.

## Execution
This is pretty simple to setup after Adeept_Raspclaw package is set up in your robot. Just change into this package directory and execute the code like so:

__./lean_left.py__

and pretty much just add __./__ in front of the green highlighted text.

If you want to make changes to the code, change into the __backup_code__ directory and edit any of the codes. 

Let me know if you have any questions.
