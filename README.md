## RaspClaw Scripts
This package contains the scripts for making the raspclaw lean left, right and standup. The move.py is also in here but Adeept_raspclaws must be working in order to use this script. You can copy the __move.py__ located in the __backup_code__ directory and replace the __move.py__ in __Adeept_RaspClaw/server__ so that it prevents your robot from shutting off due to the pi not being able to handle all servos going off at once. If you have not met with me to fix your bot, this will not help you until you meet me during my office hours.

You can take this code and edit it to your liking. It is open source and I have no issue with you making edits. However, just executing this code and expecting your robot to work will take effort on your part. If you copy and paste this code without making any changes, and you show it as your final results in your final presentation, and claim it as your own code without changing anything, I will know and report it to Dr. Jamshidi.

This is merely examples on how to move your robot's legs and to give you an idea and some motivation to take it further and add modules like implementing this in a obstacle avoidance program or a object tracking program. 

If you have any questions, email me at: asibarra98@gmail.com

I will be glad to help.

## Execution
This is pretty simple to set up after Adeept_Raspclaw package is set up in your robot. Just change into this package directory and execute the code like so:

__./lean_left.py__

and pretty much just add __./__ in front of the green highlighted text.

If you want to make changes to the code, change into the __backup_code__ directory and edit any of the codes. 

Let me know if you have any questions.
