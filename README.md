## RaspClaw Scripts
This package contains the scripts for making the raspclaw lean left, right and standup. The move.py is also in here but Adeept_raspclaws must be working in order to use this script. If you have not met with me to fix your bot, this will not help you until you do so.

## Execution
This is pretty simple to setup after Adeept_Raspclaw package is set up in your robot. Just change into this directory and execute the code like so:

__./lean_left.py__

and pretty much just add __./__ in front of the green highlighted text.

If you want to make changes to the code, change into the __backup_code__ directory and edit any of the codes. 

Let me know if you have any questions.
